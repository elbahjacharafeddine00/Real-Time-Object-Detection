# Real-Time-Object-Detection
ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
ðŸ§  Project Description:
This project showcases a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv8n (Nano) model from the Ultralytics library and a live webcam feed with OpenCV. The goal is to efficiently detect and classify objects in a video stream with minimal latency.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Integration of YOLOv8 for cutting-edge object detection.

Live webcam feed processing using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture).

Dynamic real-time detection and annotation of objects on the video frame.

Adjustable confidence threshold (conf=0.5) to control detection sensitivity.

Clean UI display using cv2.imshow and graceful shutdown with cv2.destroyAllWindows.

ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:
Python

OpenCV

Ultralytics YOLOv8 (yolov8n.pt pretrained model)

âœ… Use Cases:
Surveillance systems

Object counting

Human detection in smart environments

Entry-level computer vision demos for learning or client showcases
